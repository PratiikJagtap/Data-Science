    "# Evaluation Matrics:\n",
    "### 1) Linear Regression-\n",
    "    ~ Linear means straight line relationship between input & output if one value increses, other increases & one decreases other also decreases at constant rate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ( Formula = Y = B₀ + B₁x + E\n",
    "      B₀ – intercept\n",
    "      B₁ – coefficient\n",
    "      Y – target\n",
    "      E – error\n",
    "      X – independent variable )\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Follwoing are important mterics in linear regression,\n",
    "1) **MSE**:\n",
    "   - It is the diffrence between actual & predicted which we call error. It suqares the all error values & get the mean of sqaure of error.\n",
    "   - MSE Range 0 to Infinity\n",
    "   - MSE closer to 0 better the model  \n",
    "2) **RMSE**:\n",
    "   - It is root of MSE\n",
    "   - It shows error of actual values because we root the squared error values so it becomes original mean of error values.\n",
    "   - Range 0 to Infinity\n",
    "   - RMSE closer to 0 better the model\n",
    "   - This is always little smaller than MSE\n",
    "3) **R² Score**:\n",
    "   - It measures how much variance in dependent variable(Y) is explained by independent variable(s)(X)\n",
    "   - Range 0 to 1\n",
    "   - Closer to 1 better the model\n",
    "   - *Formula* = SSR / SSR + SSE\n",
    "   - example-\n",
    "     - If my R² is 0.77 then my model is able to explain 0.77 variance in dependent variable based on independent variable but my model is not able to explain 0.23 in dependent variable based on independent variable\n",
    "    - *NOTE*: There is problem with R² Suppose we are predicting house price model 1 uses area(variable) R² = 0.80 & model 2 uses area + color of the door(variables) then R² = 0.82. Here color of the door doesn't really help but R² increased anyway that's why we are using Adjusted R². If new variable improves model then Adjusted R² increases & New variable is useless then Adjusted R² decreases.\n",
    "4) **Adjusted R²**:\n",
    "   - Formula = 1-[(1−R²)×(N−1)/(N−K−1)]\n",
    "   - N = No. of rows\n",
    "   - K = No. of columns\n",
    "   - Adjusted R² tells how well the model fits after adjusting for extra variables\n",
    "   - It is more honest\n",
    "5) **MAPE**:\n",
    "   - Mean Absolute Error in Percentage\n",
    "   - lower the MAPE better the model\n",
    "  \n",
    "6) **MAE**:\n",
    "   - Mean Absolute Error in actual units\n",
    "   - lower the MAE better the model"
